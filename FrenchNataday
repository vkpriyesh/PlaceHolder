 the French National Day, I've the following thoughts:

1. *Icebreaker Activity - "Two Truths and a Lie - French Edition"*: We all share three "facts" about France, but one of them is a lie. Others have to guess which one's not true. This can be a fun way to kick-start the event.

2. *French Cultural Exchange*: Our French colleagues can share interesting facts about French culture and traditions. It'll be a great learning opportunity for all of us!

3. *French Language Challenge*: We could split into groups and act out common French phrases for others to guess. A fun way to learn some French and work as a team.

4. *French Cuisine Tasting*: I'm sure everyone would love to try some popular French dishes and drinks. We could have Baguette, Croissant, Macarons, CrÃªpes, and of course, a selection of French cheeses.
