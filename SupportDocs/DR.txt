What are the disaster recovery measures that needs to be taken for Azure infrastructure? The application consists of a standalone desktop applications hosted on Azure VMs. The database is hosted in Azure SQL. The networking is managed by application gateways. Please provide a robust plan to achieve fast disaster recovery in case of service failures. The current infrastructure is hosted in South East asia. The disaster recovery site could be east Asia or UK

Disaster recovery (DR) is a critical aspect of any infrastructure, and it is essential to have a plan in place to ensure fast recovery from service failures. Here's a robust disaster recovery plan for your Azure infrastructure:

Backup and Restore: Regularly back up the data of the Azure SQL database and store it in a secure location. In case of a disaster, the data can be restored to a new Azure SQL database in a different region.

Azure Site Recovery: Azure Site Recovery (ASR) is a disaster recovery solution that can be used to replicate and recover virtual machines (VMs) in the event of a disaster. ASR can replicate the Azure VMs hosting the desktop applications to the disaster recovery site in East Asia or the UK.

Networking: In the event of a disaster, you can use Azure Traffic Manager to redirect traffic to the disaster recovery site. The application gateway can be configured to redirect traffic to the disaster recovery site in case the primary site becomes unavailable.

Testing: Regularly test the disaster recovery plan to ensure it works as expected and identify any potential issues that need to be addressed.

Documentation: Document the disaster recovery plan and ensure that all stakeholders are familiar with it.

Review and update: Regularly review and update the disaster recovery plan to ensure it remains relevant and effective.

By implementing these steps, you can ensure that your Azure infrastructure has a robust disaster recovery plan in place, and you can achieve fast recovery in case of service failures.

Please elaborate on backup & restore. Give detailed steps on how to achieve that?

Backup and restore is a critical aspect of disaster recovery for Azure SQL databases. Here are the detailed steps to achieve backup and restore for an Azure SQL database:

Create a Backup:
a. Log in to the Azure portal.
b. Select the Azure SQL database that you want to back up.
c. Click on the "Backup" option in the left-side menu.
d. Select "Long-term retention" and choose a retention period for the backup.
e. Click on the "Create Backup" button to initiate the backup process.

Store the Backup:
a. Once the backup is complete, you can store it in a secure location, such as Azure Blob Storage or Azure File Share.
b. To store the backup in Azure Blob Storage, you can use the Azure Backup service.
c. To store the backup in Azure File Share, you can use the Azure Files service.

Restore the Backup:
a. In the event of a disaster, log in to the Azure portal.
b. Select the "Restore" option in the left-side menu.
c. Choose the backup source (e.g., Azure Blob Storage or Azure File Share) and select the backup that you want to restore.
d. Choose the target Azure SQL database or create a new database for the restore.
e. Click on the "Restore" button to initiate the restore process.

By following these steps, you can ensure that you have a robust backup and restore process in place for your Azure SQL databases. It is important to regularly test the backup and restore process to ensure that it works as expected in the event of a disaster.

Write an azure function with powershell script to create backup of azure sql with long term retention. The azure function should run every week on Thursday 

Here's an Azure Functions with a PowerShell script that you can use to create a backup of your Azure SQL database with long-term retention and run it every Thursday:

Create an Azure Function:
a. Log in to the Azure portal.
b. Click on the "Create a resource" button and select "Function App."
c. Fill in the required information and select "PowerShell" as the runtime stack.
d. Click on the "Create" button to create the function app.

Create a Timer-Triggered Function:
a. In the Azure Functions portal, click on the "+" button to create a new function.
b. Select the "Timer trigger" option.
c. Fill in the required information, such as the function name and timer schedule.
d. For the schedule, use the following expression to run the function every Thursday: 0 0 * * 4
e. Click on the "Create" button to create the function.

Write the PowerShell Script:
a. Replace the default script with the following code:

bash
Copy code
param($Timer)

# Import the Azure RM modules
Import-Module AzureRM.Profile
Import-Module AzureRM.Sql

# Connect to Azure
Login-AzureRmAccount

# Set the Azure SQL database context
$Context = New-AzureRmSqlDatabaseBackupLongTermRetentionPolicy -ResourceGroupName "<ResourceGroupName>" -ServerName "<ServerName>" -DatabaseName "<DatabaseName>" -RetentionDays 90

# Create the Azure SQL database backup
Backup-AzureRmSqlDatabase -Context $Context

Write-Output "Azure SQL database backup created with long-term retention successfully!"
Note: Replace <ResourceGroupName>, <ServerName>, and <DatabaseName> with the actual values for your Azure SQL database.

Publish the Function:
a. Click on the "Save and run" button to save and run the function.
b. If the function runs successfully, click on the "Publish" button to publish the changes.
By following these steps, you can create an Azure Function that creates a backup of your Azure SQL database with long-term retention and runs it every Thursday. You can modify the script to suit your specific requirements.
