Certainly, for a Helm chart with Ingress, Service, Deployment, and ConfigMaps all located within the same directory, you would typically structure your directories and reference files as follows:

```
nginx-ingress/
├── charts/
├── templates/
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── service.yaml
│   ├── ingress.yaml
│   └── configmap.yaml
├── Chart.yaml
└── values.yaml
```

In the `ingress.yaml` file within the `templates/` directory, you would reference the Service and ConfigMap as needed:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: {{ include "nginx-ingress.fullname" . }}
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/server-snippet: |
      {{- readFile "configmap.yaml" | nindent 6 }}
spec:
  rules:
  - host: "{{ .Values.ingress.host }}"
    http:
      paths:
      - path: "{{ .Values.ingress.path }}"
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: {{ include "nginx-ingress.fullname" . }}
            port:
              number: {{ .Values.service.port }}
```

In the `deployment.yaml` file, you might have something like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ include "nginx-ingress.fullname" . }}
spec:
  replicas: {{ .Values.replicaCount }}
  ...
```

And your `service.yaml` could look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: {{ include "nginx-ingress.fullname" . }}
spec:
  ports:
    - port: {{ .Values.service.port }}
      targetPort: http
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: {{ include "nginx-ingress.name" . }}
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: {{ .Release.Name }}
```

The `configmap.yaml` would include the custom error pages or redirection logic:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {{ include "nginx-ingress.fullname" . }}-errors
data:
  server-snippet: |
    location @custom_400 {
      return 302 {{ .Values.customErrorPages.custom400 }};
    }
    ...
```

Ensure that your `values.yaml` file contains all necessary values that are referenced in your templates.

To deploy this Helm chart, you would run `helm install nginx-ingress ./nginx-ingress`, assuming your current directory is the parent directory of the `nginx-ingress/` folder.

Remember to adjust the placeholders and values to match the actual configuration of your environment.
