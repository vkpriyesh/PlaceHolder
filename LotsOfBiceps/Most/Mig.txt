Can we migrate an existing created cluster inside a vnet? The existing cluster doesn't belong to any vnet currently 

ChatGPT

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, it is not possible to migrate an existing Databricks workspace to a different VNet or to add an existing Databricks workspace into a VNet if it wasn't initially configured to do so.

The networking configuration for a Databricks workspace is defined at creation time and cannot be changed later. If you need to move a Databricks workspace into a VNet, you would need to create a new workspace with the desired VNet configuration and then migrate your notebooks, libraries, jobs, and other workspace assets to the new workspace.

The migration process could include the following steps:

Export all notebooks from the existing workspace.

Record all job configurations in the existing workspace.

Create a new Databricks workspace in the desired VNet.

Import all notebooks to the new workspace.

Recreate all jobs in the new workspace.

Reconfigure any data connections (such as mounting points) in the new workspace.

This process does not move data stored in DBFS, so you would need to handle that separately if necessary. Note that these steps are relatively manual and could be time-consuming if you have a large number of notebooks and jobs.

I would recommend consulting the official Azure Databricks documentation or contacting Azure support to confirm the current capabilities and best practices for your situation, as this information might have changed after my training data.

User

For the above migration, provide step by step guidance in great detail. 

Explain each step according to the best practices

ChatGPT

Here's a step-by-step guide to migrate your notebooks, jobs, and libraries from an existing Databricks workspace to a new one. This will help you move from a workspace that isn't associated with a VNet to one that is.

Export all notebooks from the existing workspace

The first step is to export all the notebooks from the existing Databricks workspace. You can do this manually through the workspace UI, or automate it using the Databricks CLI or REST API.

Here is a CLI command to export a notebook:

bash

Copy code

databricks workspace export /path/in/workspace /local/path

Repeat this command for all notebooks, or write a script to do it in bulk.

Record all job configurations in the existing workspace

The next step is to record the configurations of all the jobs in your workspace. Unfortunately, there's no built-in functionality to export job configurations, so you will have to do it manually. You can find the configuration for each job in the Job Settings tab in the Databricks workspace UI.

Make sure to record all necessary details like the notebook path, schedule, alert settings, timeout, parameters, and retry settings.

Create a new Databricks workspace in the desired VNet

Use the Bicep templates provided in the previous step to create a new Databricks workspace in the desired VNet. This can be done via the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.

Import all notebooks to the new workspace

After the new workspace is set up, the next step is to import all the notebooks into the new workspace. This can be done manually through the workspace UI, or automated using the Databricks CLI or REST API.

Here is a CLI command to import a notebook:

lua

Copy code

databricks workspace import /local/path /path/in/workspace

Repeat this command for all notebooks, or write a script to do it in bulk.

Recreate all jobs in the new workspace

Now you can recreate all the jobs in the new workspace using the configurations you recorded earlier. This can be done manually through the workspace UI, or automated using the Databricks Jobs API.

Here is a CLI command to create a job:

css

Copy code

databricks jobs create --json '{"name": "job_name", ...}'

Replace the ... with the rest of your job configuration. Repeat this command for all jobs, or write a script to do it in bulk.

Reconfigure any data connections in the new workspace

Finally, you will need to reconfigure any data connections in the new workspace. This includes mounting points to Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake Store, JDBC connections to databases, or configurations for table access in the Databricks workspace.

The exact steps will depend on your specific data sources and how they were configured in the old workspace. You will likely need to rerun any mounting commands or reenter connection details in the new workspace.

Data migration

If your notebooks use data from DBFS (Databricks File System), you will need to migrate this data. DBFS data is not tied to a workspace, but is stored in an Azure Blob Storage account managed by Databricks.

You can either keep using the same DBFS data in the new workspace, or you can copy it to a new location (like a blob container in a storage account associated with the new VNet) and update your notebooks to use the new data location.

Here is a CLI command to copy data from DBFS to a local path:

bash

Copy code

databricks fs cp dbfs:/path/in/dbfs /local/path

And here is a

User

Please continue the above response from where you left 

ChatGPT

Sure, let's continue.

Here is a CLI command to copy data from DBFS to a local path:

bash

Copy code

databricks fs cp dbfs:/path/in/dbfs /local/path

And here is a CLI command to copy data from a local path back to DBFS:

bash

Copy code

databricks fs cp /local/path dbfs:/path/in/dbfs

If you are copying data to a new location in DBFS or to a different storage account, make sure to update your notebooks to use the new data location.

Recreate clusters in the new workspace

If you have specific cluster configurations you want to keep, you will need to recreate these in the new workspace. Record the details of existing clusters (like the Databricks runtime version, node types, number of workers, and any configurations like init scripts or spark configs) and then recreate these clusters in the new workspace.

Unfortunately, there's no built-in functionality to export cluster configurations, so you will have to do it manually. You can find the configuration for each cluster in the Clusters section of the Databricks workspace UI.

Testing

After all the steps are completed, it's important to test your notebooks and jobs in the new workspace to ensure everything is running as expected. This includes checking that data connections are working, that the results of notebook computations are as expected, and that jobs are running successfully.

Decommission the old workspace

Once you have confirmed that everything is running as expected in the new workspace, you can decommission the old workspace. Be careful with this step â€“ once a workspace is deleted, it cannot be recovered. Make sure you have successfully migrated everything you need before proceeding with this step.

It's worth noting that this process is quite manual and can be time-consuming if you have a large number of notebooks, jobs, and data connections to migrate. Depending on your specific use case, you may want to consider automating some of these steps using the Databricks CLI or REST API, or using a configuration management tool like Terraform or Ansible.

Create a migration cut off plan for production workspace 

ChatGPT

Creating a migration cut-off plan is a crucial step when migrating a production workspace. It's important to minimize downtime and ensure that data is not lost or corrupted during the migration process. Here is a step-by-step guide for creating a cut-off plan:

Preparation:

Identify all assets in the current workspace that need to be migrated. This includes notebooks, libraries, jobs, and data connections.

Identify all data sources and decide how they will be handled during the migration.

Train your team on the migration process and the new workspace.

Update any documentation or runbooks to reflect the new workspace and any changes to procedures.

Communication:

Communicate the upcoming migration to all stakeholders. This includes not only the technical team, but also any business users or teams that rely on the outputs from your Databricks jobs.

Provide clear information on the timeline for the migration, and what will change after the migration.

Dry Run:

Perform a dry run of the migration in a non-production environment. This will help you identify and resolve any issues before the actual migration.

Final Sync and Cut-off:

Decide on a cut-off point for changes in the old workspace. After this point, no new changes should be made in the old workspace.

Perform a final sync of notebooks, libraries, and job configurations from the old workspace to the new workspace.

If you're migrating data, perform a final sync of data from the old data sources to the new data sources.

Switch to the New Workspace:

Once the final sync is complete, switch all processes and users over to the new workspace.

Update any job schedules or triggers to use the new workspace.

Testing and Monitoring:

Perform comprehensive testing in the new workspace to ensure that everything is working as expected.

Monitor the new workspace closely for any issues. Have a plan in place for how to handle any issues that arise.

Decommission the Old Workspace:

Once you are confident that everything is running smoothly in the new workspace, you can decommission the old workspace.

Be sure to back up any necessary data before decommissioning.

Remember, the migration process can be complex and time-consuming. It's important to plan carefully and test thoroughly to ensure a smooth transition.

The current databricks workspace is linked with data factory & uses the cluster IDs & other information of current databricks workspace. What all needs to be considered regarding data factory during this process?

ChatGPT

When migrating a Databricks workspace that is linked to an Azure Data Factory, there are a number of considerations to take into account. The Data Factory pipelines that are utilizing Databricks activities will be referring to the old Databricks workspace, and these will need to be updated to point to the new workspace. Here is a step-by-step process:

Identify Databricks Activities: Go through all your Data Factory pipelines and identify which ones are using Databricks activities. Take note of the specifics of each activity, such as the Databricks workspace they're linked to, the cluster they're using, the notebooks they're running, and any parameters they're passing to those notebooks.

Migrate Databricks Workspace: Follow the process described in previous steps to migrate your Databricks workspace to a new VNet.

Update Databricks Linked Service: In Azure Data Factory, you need to create a new Databricks linked service that points to your new Databricks workspace. You can do this in the Azure portal by going to your Data Factory resource, clicking on 'Author & Monitor', then clicking on 'Connections' and 'Linked Services' to create a new linked service.

Update Databricks Activities: Update all the Databricks activities in your Data Factory pipelines to use the new Databricks linked service. Make sure to update the specifics of each activity if necessary. For example, if you're using a new cluster in your Databricks workspace, update the cluster ID in your Databricks activities.

Test Your Pipelines: After updating your Databricks activities, run your pipelines and monitor them to make sure they're working correctly. Check the output of the Databricks activities and make sure it's what you expect.

Monitor: Once everything is working as expected, continue to monitor your pipelines to ensure they're running smoothly. Make any necessary adjustments as issues come up.

This process will ensure that your Data Factory pipelines continue to function correctly after migrating your Databricks workspace. It's important to thoroughly test your pipelines after making these changes to catch any issues early on.

What all needs to be taken care in terms of secret scopes? 

ChatGPT

Secret scopes in Azure Databricks are used to store secrets, such as database connection strings or storage account keys, securely. When migrating from one Databricks workspace to another, there are several considerations to take into account with respect to secret scopes:

Identify all secret scopes in the source workspace: You'll need to determine which secret scopes are being used, and what secrets they contain. Keep in mind that the contents of a secret scope can't be exported or viewed directly for security reasons, so you will need to have a record of these secrets outside of Databricks.

Recreate the secret scopes in the target workspace: In the new Databricks workspace, you'll need to recreate all of the secret scopes from your old workspace. This can be done using the Databricks CLI or REST API.

Here's an example of creating a secret scope using the Databricks CLI:

bash

Copy code

databricks secrets create-scope --scope <scope_name>

Recreate the secrets in the target workspace: For each secret in the old workspace, you'll need to create a corresponding secret in the new workspace.

Here's an example of creating a secret using the Databricks CLI:

bash

Copy code

databricks secrets put --scope <scope_name> --key <key_name> --string-value <secret_value>

Update references to secrets in your notebooks and jobs: If you have any notebooks or jobs in your workspace that reference these secrets, you'll need to update these references to use the secret scopes in the new workspace. The exact changes will depend on how you're referencing the secrets in your code, but it will likely involve changing the secret scope name and the secret key.

Testing: Make sure to thoroughly test any notebooks or jobs that use these secrets after migrating to the new workspace. This will help ensure that your secrets are being correctly accessed and that your code is functioning as expected.

Remember, secrets are sensitive data and should be handled with care. Make sure to follow your organization's security policies when working with secrets.
